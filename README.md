# Data Exploration Project: Movie Insights ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š

## Introduction

Welcome to my data exploration project focused on uncovering insights within movie data. This project is a showcase of my data analysis skills using Python, particularly leveraging Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for effective data manipulation and visualization.

## Code Highlights

### Data Handling
- Efficiently managed data using Pandas to ensure cleanliness and consistency.
- Identified and handled missing data to maintain data integrity.
- Detected and dropped duplicates to avoid redundancy.

### Visualization
- Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for compelling visualizations.
- Explored relationships with scatter plots and regression plots.
- Created a correlation matrix heatmap for a deeper understanding of feature interactions.

### Insights

- Discovered a high correlation between budget and gross earnings.
- Identified votes and budget as key factors influencing gross earnings.
- Noted a low correlation with the 'company' feature.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mendenson/correlation-python.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## How to Use

Explore the Jupyter Notebook file (`Movie Correlation Project.ipynb`) to delve into the code and visualize the findings. Feel free to modify and adapt the code for your own analyses.
